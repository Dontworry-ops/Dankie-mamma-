    <h1>Happy Birthday, Mom!</h1>
    <p>
        From the very first moment I took my breath, you were there—holding me close and filling my world with warmth and love. Mom, you have been my guiding star, always illuminating the path forward with your wisdom and kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
        I remember the countless nights you stayed up with me, whether I was sick or just needed someone to talk to. You listened patiently and offered comfort, never once showing your own exhaustion. Your strength has been my anchor, helping me navigate life’s challenges with grace.
    </p>
    <p>
        You taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. Your dedication to our family inspires me every day. I am grateful for the sacrifices you’ve made to ensure I have the opportunities to pursue my dreams. You believed in me even when I doubted myself, and for that, I am eternally thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
        On this special day, I want to celebrate you—not just as my mother, but as an incredible woman who has touched the lives of so many. Thank you for your unwavering love, your laughter, and your endless support. I hope your birthday is filled with as much joy as you have given me.

        Happy Birthday, Mom! I love you more than words can express.
